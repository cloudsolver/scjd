Choices

(I) Introduction

	This document outlines the architectural and design considerations for the requirement of the project.

(II)Architectural Considerations

	The system is layered in terms of packages. The gui connects to the network client in server mode. 
	In stand-alone mode, the gui can connect to the data layer directly.
	
	When in the server mode, the gui will connect to the network client, the client will delegate requests
	to the server component. The server will connect with the data layer, the data layer is reponsible exclusively
	to handle data and connect with the underlying database. It also ensures locking and thread synchronization.
	
	The server is available over port 1099, connections are made using JRMP

(III) Design Considerations

	The business entity model lives under the com.rohitsood.urlybird.business package. Business entities have no knowledge
	of how they are persisted, the data package knows how to persist these objects.
	
	Business Object -> Value Object -> Data Access Object
	
	BO uses DAO,	DAO uses VO,	BO modifies VO


(IV) Package Dependencies

	The data package exclusively has control over the DB file
	The util package is responsible for common functionality required by any package or layer. All classes are independent,
	other packages may hold dependencies with the classes in this package.
